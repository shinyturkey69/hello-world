<h1>The secret to financial freedom in your 20's!</h1>
<p>In todays day and age people are obsessed with making money and think that the only 
way to do it is through working more hours. Financial guru's often will tell you that the only 
way to make more money is by making it work for you in other words to work smater not 
harder. This is all true but when it comes to true financial freedom I believe 
that you should find a passion and work on it. Studies have shown that people
who are more optimistic live longer. In the context of passion I believe that people 
who are working at their passions are generally more productive, happier and 
as a result have more financial freedom.  </p>
